# Real-Time-Emotional-Recognition-using-Vision-Transformer-ViT-
This project explores the application of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for real-time emotion recognition from facial expressions. The ViT model is trained on the FER2013 dataset, which contains grayscale facial images labeled with seven emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and contempt.
